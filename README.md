# DS-Bootcamp-Work

## Offered by 365 Careers

This is a basic portfolio of work I finished while doing the Data Science Course 2022: Complete Data Science Bootcamp offered through Udemy and produced by the 365 Careers team. This consisted of data cleaning, mathmatics, machine learning models, and more. The goal of this bootcamp was to be better acquainted with tools used for data science, and the theory behind them. This was a two to three months long bootcamp, for all tools of the trade and was very insightful into how data scientist work with data. I would highly recommend it for intermediate learners who are knowledgeable already in the field of data. It helped further my knowledge while providing context to previous learning.
